# Deep Learning SOTA implementations from scratch

This is a series of "From Scratch" tutorials I'm writing for implementing cool deep learning state-of-the-art models on my own using Tensorflow and Pytorch.

> What I cannot create, I do not understand. - Richard P. Feynman

&nbsp;

Basic knowledge of concepts of Neural Networks, PyTorch and Tensorflow is assumed.


If you're new to Tensorflow, first go through the article [Tensorflow Core Tutorials](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials) and [TensorFlow 2 quickstart for beginners](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/quickstart/beginner).

If you're new to PyTorch, first read [Deep Learning with PyTorch: A 60 Minute Blitz](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html) and [Learning PyTorch with Examples](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/pytorch_with_examples.html).


In each repository, we will focus on a specific architecture by implementing the model from scratch.
